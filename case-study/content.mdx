<ContentSection title="Introduction — building a space where TV lovers can finally keep track of everything they watch (and talk about it too)">
Show-Hub started with a pretty simple frustration — you know that feeling when you finish a show, and can’t remember what episode you left off on, or which one your friend said had “the twist”? Yeah, that.  
So I built a place that keeps it all together.  

Show-Hub is a **TV show organizer platform** built with React, Node, Express, and MongoDB. It’s designed to let users track what they’re watching, write reviews, join discussions, and explore detailed show information — all from one clean, responsive interface.  

This version is still in its **prototype phase** — a foundation that works, but with room to grow. The essential features are live, but I’m still refining stability, performance, and overall polish.  
</ContentSection>

<ContentSection title="What makes Show-Hub different — a central place for shows, lists, and conversations">
At its core, Show-Hub isn’t just about tracking what you’ve watched — it’s about *connecting* with what you love and who you share it with.  

Here’s what it does:
- **Secure login/signup** with JWT-based authentication.
- **Search for any show**, complete with metadata like ratings, episode counts, air dates, and summaries.
- Dive deep into **show details** — from cast and seasons to top-rated episodes.
- **Add shows to personal lists**, so you can build your own “watching” dashboard.
- **Find other users**, browse their public lists, and read their reviews.

It’s like having IMDb, MyAnimeList, and Reddit discussions rolled into one focused hub — but tailored to TV shows.

<ContentSection title="Lists management — creating a more personal, flexible way to organize what you watch">
Everyone organizes differently. Some of us love neat categories; others just need to remember what they started.  
So Show-Hub gives you both.  

Each user begins with **three default lists** — *Plan to Watch*, *Watching*, and *Completed*.  
But if you’re the kind of person who loves curating collections like “Comfort Shows” or “Guilty Pleasures,” you can create **custom lists** too.  

You control visibility — public or private — even down to individual entries.  
And you can edit each list entry with personal data like:
- Ratings  
- Episode progress  
- Start/finish dates  
- Notes  
</ContentSection>

<ContentSection title="Writing and reading reviews — building conversations through words, not algorithms">
Ever read a review that perfectly captured what you felt about a show? That’s the kind of space I wanted to build.  

Under each show, users can **read reviews**, **like or dislike** them, and most importantly — **write their own**.  

The built-in rich text editor (powered by React-Quill) supports:
- Headings  
- Quotes  
- Code blocks  
- Embedded media (images, videos, YouTube links)  

And if you’re someone who prefers to keep your thoughts private, you can mark your review as *private*. Sometimes it’s not about sharing — it’s about remembering.
</ContentSection>

<ContentSection title="Forums — where discussions go beyond one-line reviews and become real conversations">
This part was born from the realization that people don’t just want to *rate* shows — they want to *talk* about them.  

Every show on Show-Hub has its own **dedicated forum**, where users can post topics, reply, and dive deep into fan theories or episode breakdowns.  

Replies and posts use the same **rich text editor** as reviews, so people can share images, quotes, and links — not just plain text.  

There’s even support for **forum categories**, so you can separate show-specific threads from general TV discussions. It feels like a community rather than just a content app.
</ContentSection>

<ContentSection title="Data source — keeping things accurate and up to date with real show information">
All show data comes directly from the **TVMaze API** — including metadata, cast details, and episode breakdowns.  
This keeps the information current, clean, and consistent without needing manual updates.
</ContentSection>

<ContentSection title="Under the hood — technologies that power everything behind the scenes">
The tech stack is straightforward but solid:
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)  
- **Rich Text Editor:** React-Quill  

Each piece plays its part — React for responsive UI, Node and Express for scalable routes and APIs, MongoDB for flexible data storage, and JWT for secure authentication.

<ContentSection title="Setting up the project locally — a quick note for developers who want to explore">
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Run `npm install` in both `client` and `server` directories.  
3. Add your environment variables (Mongo URI, JWT secret, TVMaze API key if applicable).  
4. Start the backend server, then run the frontend.  

You’ll have a local version running in no time.
</ContentSection>

<ContentSection title="License and next steps — where the project goes from here">
Show-Hub is open-source under the MIT License.  

But really, this is just the beginning. The next phase is about improving performance, optimizing queries, and refining how discussions and lists interact.  

Eventually, I want it to feel like the go-to space for anyone who *lives* for TV — where your lists, reviews, and communities all sit in one cozy, well-designed hub.
